A network sniffer in Python is an excellent project for understanding network traffic and packet structures. Python provides libraries like socket and scapy that make packet capturing and analysis easier. 
To enhance the provided network sniffer code with a Graphical User Interface (GUI), we can use Python's Tkinter library to make the application user-friendly.
The GUI can allow users to start and stop the packet capture, view captured packets in a table, and save packets to a file.
